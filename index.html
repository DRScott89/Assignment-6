                            <p>Hello! Welcome to my page. My name is Daashawn Scott and I am currently
                                33 years old residing in the Charlotte Metro area of North Carolina. I was
                                born on September 13, 1989 in a small city in Virginia. During my formative years
                                I attended public schooling in Prince George, VA. I graduated form Prince George High 
                                School in 2007 and continued my education at Norfolk State University in Norfolk, VA.
                                In 2011, I completed my undergraduate studies and recieved my B.A in Sociology. After
                                a few years of pursuing my career in criminal justice, I received my first job offer as 
                                a Correctional Officer at Sussexx II State Prison in 2013. The following year, I was accepted
                                into the University of Baltimore and shortly after accepted and internship with the Bureau of 
                                Prisons as a Student Research Trainee. In 2016, I completed my M.S in Criminal Justice and was 
                                promoted to Records Management Analyst. In 2020 I received another promotion as a Correctional
                                Programs Supervisor and relocated to Yazoo City, MS. After one year in this position, I relocated
                                back to the East Coast and have most recently been working with Electrolux as a Warranty Coordinator.
